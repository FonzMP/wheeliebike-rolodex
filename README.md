# About the Wheeliebike Rolodex

Wheeliebike Rolodex is a Sinatra Application used to keep track of all your motorcycle habits (purchases). With a strong passion for anything two wheels, I like to incorporate items I'm passionate about into my coding. 

This application provides its users an environment to list their motorcycles and see a list of their bikes, as well as other user's pride and joys.


# Running the Application
To run this application simply fork and clone the repo. Once cloned, make sure you run ```bundle install```, and then you'll need to run ```rake db:migrate``` and start the application using ```shotgun```.
